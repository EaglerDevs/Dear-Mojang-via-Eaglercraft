# Dear Mojang,
I'm sure "Eaglercraft" is a project that is on the top of your DMCA list. We (via the Eaglerbrothersâ„¢) are highly aware of Minecraft is about $20. 


And the idea of Minecraft is for kids or grown-ups to have fun on your platform right? 


But, money can't buy happiness.


We put the labor into making Minecraft compatible with HTML and you violently threaten us to shut it down or get banned from Github.
It is more fun when you can easily access Minecraft from a browser. Eaglercraft can run on school chromebooks and give you a decent framerate.
I think your fanbase will be MUCH happier if they could access Minecraft that you didn't need to pay for and Minecraft would SKYROCKET in popularity.


You should really consider this because some people think that Minecraft is a dead game.
Don't just make Minecraft for the money. Have the joy and satisfaction that kids are intrested in YOUR game.
Plus, why are you still DMCA'ing Eaglercraft clients? Eaglercraft client are just going to keep being made and forked on Github. Its like a fighter jet trying to catch a UFO.


The goal of Eaglercraft was never to pirate the game, it was just to port it to the browser, and the years of time and effort put into the port should not be killed off so violently.
Thank you for reading <3
